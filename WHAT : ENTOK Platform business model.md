### Economic and social effects of ENTOK Platform

**Social effects**

Because blockchain technology is applied to Sur-Ple Token issued by ENTOK, the issuance is transparent and the transaction record can be verified in all processes of distribution and consumption and consequentially, it keeps the consumer's risk at minimum. The transaction ledger based on blockchain technology enables transparent and reliable transactions between entertainment agencies and partners. Because of these characteristics, the dividend information based on profit generated by the project is open transparently to the investors, ensuring the continued reliability between investors and entertainment producers.

**Economic effects**

Frauds are frequently occurring in off-line and online transactions because existing paper gift cards and new-type gift cards (mobile gift cards, mobile coupons, etc.) are easy to forge and falsify.

As of 2016, gift card market of South Korea is estimated to reach 11.3 trillion KRW. The issuance of paper gift cards is estimated to be worth more than 9.6 trillion KRW according to the data from Korea Minting and Security Printing Corporation and the estimated value of new-type gift cards is expected to exceed 1.7 trillion KRW according to the survey from National Assembly Research Service. Smart contract ERC-20 Sur-Ple Token based on blockchain has an unlimited potential as an effective alternative to existing paper gift cards and new-type gift cards by enhancing security, transparency and reliability. Also, in the case of paper gift cards, it takes a lot of cost and time to issue, distribute and collect. With Sur-Ple Token, this cost is close to zero. Through high-performance system and Internet infrastructure, the whole process of issuing and distributing can be done instantly. In the case of existing paper gift cards and new-type gift cards, it is no small burden on traders due to high commissions. Sur-Ple Token is providing a lot of profits for traders through its low commission policy.
