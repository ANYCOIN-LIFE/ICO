There is a good outlook for Hallyu entertainment industry which is continuously creating values based on creative ideas. World-famous singer Psy\'s \"Gangnam Style\" has played a significant role in reconsidering nation brand as well as creating tremendous economic value. K-Pop which plays a leading role of Hallyu entertainment is no longer just a recreation to listen, watch or enjoy. It has become a solid platform for the world entertainment content market as well as a bridge linking between countries or generations. For instance, EXO, a famous idol group (genuine Korean expression for a pop band), is evaluated the economic value of over 1 trillion KRW in the next decade and similarly, the social and economic value of Hallyu entertainment is expected to be larger than any other. Consumer responses are also changing. The market is increasingly anxious for the talented musicians. Since 2014, the public's expectations have been high and various broadcast audition programs have demonstrated that the successful applicants have the talents for singing, dancing and composing.

This change in Hallyu entertainment market, especially in idol market, raises K-POP cultural standard and leads global value improvement and global market extension. On the contrary, successful business remains the malformed structure which depends on the ability of large agency. This is also why we need a leading investment model for continuous research and development of high-quality Entertainment Items[^1] for the growing global market.
