### **WHY : Cryptocurrency into the entertainment market**

As a variety of creative businesses are emerging, those are combining their products with IoT environment and utilizing it as a stepping stone to grow. On the other hand, Hallyu entertainment market is built around large entertainment agency, which is not adequately adapted to find and nurture various entertainment items and to enter the market. Things9 aims to consider these issues together and look for solutions through the convergence of technology and culture.

### Current status and prospect of Hallyu entertainment industry

Let\'s observe the current status of South Korea, which sets regulatory barriers interrupting the development and growth of various entertainment items. Even if an idol group, great item, is formed, it is difficult to commercialize the product except for large agencies due to limitations in infrastructure such as idol group development, fund-raising, operation and marketing. On the other hand, the international situation is acting as a serious variable for large agencies. The economic impact of Chinese retaliation over THAAD and Japan\'s anti-Korean sentiment has been more than expected. The economic damage of South Korea due to a boycott on Korean product is estimated at 8.5 trillion KRW according to statistics. There is no proper countermeasure to cope with international circumstances and economic issues. Especially, small and medium sized entertainment companies are having difficulty in finding solutions for funds and human resources for globalization. Consequentially, it is inevitable to have investment plans that will continue to search for high-quality entertainment items aimed at global market, which are not limited to specific countries in Hallyu entertainment market.

### Change of fund-raising way : ICO

Previously, venture capital has been a wide spread medium of fund-raising. Currently, the development of block chains and cryptocurrency technology is changing trend across business fund-raising. Now it is possible to attract Korean and global investments in a short period of time through the Internet and mobile device. It brings about change not only in the raising method, but also in the size of the investment. The size of investment through ICO has already overtaken that of existing venture capital. Bitcoin is now at the \$5,000 mark in 2017 and there has been increasing interest in cryptocurrency around the world. As of September 25^th^, 2017, the global virtual currency market is worth about \$130 billion (approximately 150 trillion KRW).

A lot of resources are needed to find and develop high-quality entertainment items. ICO provides the most effective investment environment for finding and developing entertainment items. The investment funds raised through ICO will be used to develop items and the distribution and sales of the outstanding items will lead to the growth of both entertainment producers and investors.

**The investment of cryptocurrency based on blockchain is the most democratic investment model with the advantage of high potential.**

Cryptocurrency has no government regulators. The circulation, verification, and management of currency can be done autonomously because the cryptocurrency market is steadily growing on the basis of its reliable technology. This is reflected in the fact that the daily trading volume of cryptocurrency market in South Korea is about 2.6 trillion KRW, which is equivalent to that of KOSDAQ market. It does not mean simply that the market is growing but it means that the market is maturing. What is the strength of ICO which makes the market mature?
